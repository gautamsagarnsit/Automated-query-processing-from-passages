This drain occurred through the interest that India paid for peregrine debts of the East India Company, military expenditure, ensured returns on peregrine investment in railways and other infrastructure, importing all stationery from England, â€˜home chargesâ€™ paid for the Secretary of State in Britain and salaries, pensions and training costs of military and civilian staff employed by the British state to rule India. Even if this drain was a minuscule fraction of the value of Indiaâ€™s total exported, if invested within the country it could have engendered a surplus to build a capitalist economy. \n",
